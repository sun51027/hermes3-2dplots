# hermes3-2dplots

This is the two-dim plot tool. Must use [xhermes](https://github.com/boutproject/xhermes) and [sdtools](https://github.com/mikekryjak/sdtools) to read files.

The real path is on Viking:/users/jpm590/2dspace/post-processing/xhermes 

- `single_plot.py`: simple file to illustrate profiles so a single data.

- `tune_puff.py`: use argumnet to tune the puff rate. Currently is only for MAST-U. The script is organised by ChatGPT and credit to Mike's [mast-u notebook](https://github.com/mikekryjak/notebooks/blob/master/mast-u/grid%20work/2024-02-14%20-%20Add%20core%20sources.ipynb). Useful functions can be found (grid_fields.py)[https://github.com/mikekryjak/sdtools/blob/4242b6f0a55edf66d0b6e6f706bb7dc8515eb143/hermes3/grid_fields.py]
